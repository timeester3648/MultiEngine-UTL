# Project roadmap

This file contains a rough roadmap of planned features.

## Future C++20 migration

### Requirements

**C++20** should have a statistical majority of users. As of now that title belongs to **C++17**.

### Minimal task list

Before migration following tasks are to be finished:
- Finish all modules below version `1.0.0` **(mvl remaining)**
- Standardize benchmarks (using standard `benchmarks/common.hpp`) **(done ✔)**
- Standardize tests (using standard `tests/common.hpp`) **(done ✔)**
- Write unit tests for all reasonably testable modules **(mvl remaining)**
- Add all documentation examples to the build process **(done ✔)**
- Switch building to CMake presets **(done ✔)**
- Add CI workflows for all major platforms **(done ✔)**
- Ensure full documentation coverage **(done ✔)**

Once this is done, the current branch can be archived as `cpp17` branch, while `master` moves on to C++20.

### Migration refactors
